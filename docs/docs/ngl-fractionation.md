Aspen Plus is a powerful tool for process simulation, but when combined with machine learning,
it can accelerate sensitivity analysis and optimization.

## Step 1: Define the process
I built a base case for NGL fractionation...

## Step 2: Create a data bridge
Exported simulation data to CSV for ML model training.
